# CompArchAssembler

*Benny Yan, Alvin Nwachuchukwu, Sai Gatram, Xunde Wang*

###1. Where is the project?

We have created a github repository that has all of the mips source code. We have all of the knowledge ready to get started. The research phase shall begin *immediately* and will be finished in 3 weeks time.

Status of the project, what parts of the project have been done and what parts need to be done. It would be helpful if this section contains the phases (or milestones) of the project, e.g. investigation, design, test, document etc... and the planned completion date for each phase. Do not worry if the project is not on time! This is an opportunity to revisit  the project and adjust the projected completion dates for the phases based on what have been completed.


###2. What is the role of each member? And where you are for the tasks that were assigned to you?

The roles have been distributed to primarily but not exclusively the following positions:

- **Benny** *Research and syntatical lead* He will be in charge of researching the methodology of understanding code and parsing it to machine code. He will understand a holistic view of the project.

- **Alvin** *Code Conversion lead* He will be in charge of writing the algorithm to convert and parse information from one type to another.

- **Sai** *Code Interpretation lead* He will be in charge of interpreting the the assembly language and writing methods to convert it to machine code.

- **Xunde** *Media and debugging lead* He will be in charge of making sure the code will be in ship shape as well as making the video production. 

###3. When will be next major milestone and how does the team plan to reach there?

  **Next Milestone** research and understand how to open a file and obtain the mips assembly language and store everything from that file into a register or stack.
  - we will achieve this by going to class and learning.
   - we will pass this class
  - we will do research a home
